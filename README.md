# 2512-attenuator
RF-attenuator from 1W 2512 size resistors with both BNC and SMA connectors. Works OK from DC to 30MHz.

Measured with NanoVNA-H4 using NanoVNA saver

PCB size: 71.5 x  25 x 1.6 mm

PCB Stackup: Two layer FR-4 (No impedance control) 

Traces are not 50 ohm as this is mainly for < 50 MHz use and the size of the entire PCB is thus significantly smaller than the wavelength at this frequency. 

I tried to only use resistors from the E12 series as much as possible.

This calculator was used, with the modification that i used two parallel resistors for each position for increased thermal handling and to achieve a resistance closer to the calculated values.
